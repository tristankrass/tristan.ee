 Hey, my name is Tristan and I am learning software engineering. I will be mainly posting my thoughts on software  development. That means that I will be writing technical posts on some specific topic. For example: I am currently Learning java and a future post might be something similar to "Streams in Java 11". Though I will be posting some other content – rest assure they will be related to technology.

*If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to contact me tristan@tristan.ee*
